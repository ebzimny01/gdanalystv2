# GitHub Authentication Options Comparison

GitHub discontinued password authentication for Git operations in August 2021 to improve security. Here's why you need to use one of the alternatives and how they compare:

## Why Password Authentication Was Removed
- Vulnerable to brute force attacks
- No granular permissions control
- No easy way to revoke access
- No audit trail for access

## Authentication Options Comparison

| Authentication Method | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Personal Access Token** | - Fine-grained permissions<br>- Can be revoked anytime<br>- Can set expiration | - Must be manually renewed<br>- Must be securely stored | - Automation scripts<br>- CI/CD systems |
| **SSH Keys** | - No token to remember<br>- No expiration<br>- Very secure | - Initial setup more complex<br>- Needs key management | - Daily development<br>- WSL environments |
| **GitHub CLI** | - Easy setup<br>- Handles auth automatically | - Requires additional software | - Command line users<br>- Multiple repos |
| **OAuth Apps** | - GUI-based authentication<br>- Easy for beginners | - Limited to GUI environments | - Desktop environments<br>- GUI git clients |

## Recommended Approach for WSL Users

For WSL development with GitHub, the **SSH key** approach is recommended because:

1. It avoids credential manager issues between Windows/WSL
2. It doesn't require token renewal
3. It's the most reliable for command-line operations
4. It eliminates the need for credential storage

See the SSH keys guide for setup instructions.
